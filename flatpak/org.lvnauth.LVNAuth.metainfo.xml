      LVNAuth is a desktop application that lets you create and view visual novels.
      Manage your visual novel, from beginning to end, using LVNAuth&apos;s GUI editor. A command system: You can start or stop actions in your visual novel by using some simple commands. A built-in Wizard window will guide you with using commands so you don&apos;t have to memorize the commands. No programming experience required. LVNAuth is made for story writers. Chapters and Scenes: You can have multiple scenes within a chapter. Simple Animations: Ability to apply character and object animations, such as fade, movement, rotate, and scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Support for backgrounds, characters, including the ability to change a character&apos;s image to show a different facial expression, and object images. Images in .png format are recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Support for Font Sprite Sheets and Font Kerning. There is also a built-in bitmap font tracing tool to convert variable width font sprite sheets to a fixed width.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compile your story into a single .lvna file, which can be opened using LVNAuth. Your viewers will need LVNAuth to view your visual novel.
