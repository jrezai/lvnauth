class RestHandler:
    """
    Pauses the main reader (not background readers).
    This is used with the <rest> command.
    
    <rest> works almost like <halt>, with the difference being that
    a mouse click will not work with <rest>, so it forces the main story
    reader to pause.
    
    Another difference is that <rest> can specify the number of frames
    to pause the main story reader, whereas <halt> can't specify a timeframe.
    
    Usage:
    The setup() method is used to initialize the rest handler.
    The tick() method is used to check if we should pause the main reader (True)
    or not (False)
