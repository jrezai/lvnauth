# LVNAuth
Visual novel creator and player

### Description

LVNAuth is a desktop application that lets you create and play visual novels. It is available for Linux and Windows.

### Main features:

- **Built-in editor**: Manage your visual novel, from beginning to end, using LVNAuth's GUI editor.

- **A command system**: You can start or stop actions in your visual novel by using simple commands. <br><br>A built-in Wizard window will guide you with using commands so you don't have to memorize the commands.

    No programming experience required. LVNAuth is made for story writers.

- **Chapters and scenes**: You can have multiple scenes within a chapter.

- **Simple animations**: Ability to apply character and object animations, such as *fade*, *movement*, *rotate*, and *scale*.  

- **Create non-linear visual novels**: Branch your stories off based on the viewer's choices. Linear visual novels can also be created.

- **Camera controls**: Use zooming and panning to direct the viewer's focus, build tension, and make your scenes more interesting.


### Other features:

- Support for backgrounds, characters, including the ability to change a character's image to show a different facial expression, and object images. Images in `.png` format are recommended.

- Support for Font Sprite Sheets and Font Kerning. There is also a built-in bitmap font tracing tool to convert variable width font sprite sheets to a fixed width.

- Compile your story into a single `.lvna` file, which can be opened using LVNAuth. Your viewers will need LVNAuth to play your visual novel.

- No programming language support. LVNAuth only allows the use of its own commands. This restriction might even make it easier to create visual novels because you don't have to learn a particular programming language to create a visual novel with LVNAuth.

### Worth noting:

- It's possible to ask the viewer questions and save the answers in the current visual novel session. Once the visual novel is closed, those answers are not saved.
*A feature is planned to save the viewer's answers for future sessions.*
