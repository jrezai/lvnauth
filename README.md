# LVNAuth
Visual novel creator and player

### Description

LVNAuth is a desktop application that lets you create and view visual novels. Currently, it is available for Linux.

### Main features:

- **Built-in Editor**: Manage your visual novel, from beginning to end, using LVNAuth's GUI editor.

- **A command system**: You can start or stop actions in your visual novel by using some simple commands. <br><br>A built-in Wizard window will guide you with using commands so you don't have to memorize the commands.

    No programming experience required. LVNAuth is made for story writers.

- **Chapters and Scenes**: You can have multiple scenes within a chapter.

- **Simple Animations**: Ability to apply character and object animations, such as *fade*, *movement*, *rotate*, and *scale*.


### Other features:

- Support for backgrounds, characters, including the ability to change a character's image to show a different facial expression, and object images. Images in `.png` format are recommended.

- Support for Font Sprite Sheets and Font Kerning. There is also a built-in bitmap font tracing tool to convert variable width font sprite sheets to a fixed width.

- Conditional logic support - branch out your visual novel with different scenes and stories depending on what the viewer chooses.

- Compile your story into a single `.lvna` file, which can be opened using LVNAuth. Your viewers will need LVNAuth to view your visual novel.

- No programming language support. LVNAuth only allows the use of its own commands. This restriction might even make it easier to create visual novels because you don't have to learn a particular programming language to create a visual novel with LVNAuth.
